If we sample more than that, only the first 15 are shown.\n- If we sample a small number of images, we waste a lot of space.\n\nAll these problems stem from our shoddy approach to step 2 in the code. Instead of using the same grid dimensions every time, they should adapt to the number of images we're showing. For example, if `n = 3`,  we should make a 6\" x 2\" grid with 1 row and 3 columns. If `n = 15`, we should make a 16\" x 4\" grid with 2 rows and 8 columns.

First, you'll need to save a version of your notebook that shows your current work by hitting the \"Commit & Run\" button. (Your work is saved automatically, but versioning your work lets you go back and look at what it was like at the point you saved it. It also let's you share a nice compiled notebook instead of just the raw code.) Then, once your notebook is finished running, you can go to the Settings tab in the panel to the left (you may have to expand it by hitting the [<] button next to the \"Commit & Run\" button) and setting the \"Visibility\" dropdown to \"Public\".\n\n# Keep Going\n\nWhen you're ready to continue, [click here](https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/functions-and-getting-help) to continue on to the next tutorial on functions and getting help."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"learntools_metadata":{"lesson_index":0,"type":"exercise"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
